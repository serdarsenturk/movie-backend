# Movie Rating System Backend

* To do all these, I have created a `requirement analysis` on Trello before starting the project.
    [Requirement Analysis](https://trello.com/b/4nqTINjL/gereksinim-analizi)
* Then, I prepared the `steps` I need to do on Trello in order.

* I used Python programming language, Django Framework(MVC based) and httpie(command-line HTTP client for the API era) in project.
* I took advantage of MVC architecture.First i created my models and their properties in Model side.
* I used serialized my models to converting to the form to be transferred.
* I created appropriate api to list movies and list movie details in View side.
* I applied appropriate urls for movies that will be listed.
